What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- When a repository is initialize, git will create a repository on that directory. This is needed to create commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- Staging area is the intermediate area between the working directory and the repository, where user adds files or changes to
  it before commiting them into the repository. The staging area is useful because you can check, add or remove items before
  you decide to commit it.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
- I can do this by using git diff or git diff --staged to compare the changes between working directory, staging area and
  repository.

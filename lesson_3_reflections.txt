When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- A remote repository is needed if you want to upload your repository to a public open source website such as github.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Because sometimes we will be creating new branches in remote repository. Pulling changes manually ensure we get the right
  version we want.

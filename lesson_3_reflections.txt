When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- A remote repository is needed if you want to upload your repository to a public open source website such as github.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Because sometimes we will be creating new branches in remote repository. Pulling changes manually ensure we get the right
  version we want.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Fork is cloning repository within Github; Clones can be done between local repositories or GitHub and local repositories;
  Branches are for commits within a repository.
